# Skyrim Trivia

### A Timed, Skyrim-themed Trivia Game
Players will be timed while they answer a set of questions about the video game, Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

### Requirements

### Features

##### Random Song, Game to Game
When players start a new game, a random song will be chosen and played while the player answers questions.

##### Automatic "Next Question"
Players do not need to do anything to go to the next question; the game automatically presents the next question after a certain time.

##### Gifs Galore
View a gif related to the question you answered, after you answer it!

### Contributing

This project was meant to be an exercise in JavaScript timers for my coding bootcamp. While you are more than welcome to fork the 
repository and modify the game for yourself, I will likely not accept pull requests. However, if you choose to review the
code and you have questions or comments for me, I am more than happy to hear them! In fact, I'd love to receive feedback on 
my code. Please feel free to email me at the address listed on my Github account.
